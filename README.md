## Exercice 2 - Dynamic Programming and Spelling Correction

Involves implementing various components of dynamic programming and spelling correction algorithms.

1. **Minimum Edit Distance Algorithm**: Implemented the minimum edit distance algorithm to calculate the similarity between two strings and print the alignment between them.
   
3. **Backtrace Implementation**: Enhanced the minimum edit distance function to include backtrace, allowing for the alignment of strings.
   
5. **Adjacency Costs**: Explored different cost functions to calculate a smarter version of the edit distance, considering adjacency costs such as keyboard layout.
   
7. **Spelling Correction**: Implemented a simple spelling correction algorithm that suggests corrections for misspelled words based on the minimum edit distance.
   
9. **Optimization Techniques**: Optimized the spelling correction algorithm by considering factors such as the first letter of the word, word length, and phonetic similarity using techniques like Soundex.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the spelling correction algorithm.
